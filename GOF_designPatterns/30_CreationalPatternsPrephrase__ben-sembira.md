# Chapter Creational Patterns - Preprhase
Ben Sembira

## (Maybe) Interesting Ideas
1. Creational patterns are here to abstract the creation of concrete classes where a function needs to create classes, but does not have any reason to choose one concrete class implementation over the other. By that making the code more flexible.

## Questions
1. The writer says that creational patterns give you flexibility in:
    1. **What** gets created
    1. **Who** creates it
    1. **How** it gets created
    1. **When** it gets created
    * I do not understand the when.
