# Chapter 8 - Boundaries


## Summarizing Instructions
When writing summaries:
1. For each sub-chapter in the chapter:
    1. **While Reading**: Add lots of points under the [Random Points](#random-points) section.
    1. **If you do not fully agree with something**: Add a point in the [Contraversial Points](#contraversial-points) section.
    1. **After finishing the sub-chapter**: Add rules to the [Rules](#rules) section
1. After finishing the chapter, write an [Overall Summary](#overall-summary) with all the main ideas.

## Random Points
1. The writer says that we should not use third party types in our boundary interfaces. I am not sure what is boundary, does he mean the most outer interface of a product? I will check the internet and come back. Did not get a very good answer.
1. He talks about learning tests. I really think I like the concept. It is great because it can make a developer feel comfortable with updating a depency without feer of crashing all the program. I have to say that this is not ideal because lot of tests can be written for this manner. Maybe it could have been great if every library whould have give access to its system tests so that the developers can watch and learn from them, and then integrate the tests into their own project so that if a depencey gets updated, a developer can choose to not update the tests and validate that none of its assumptions was broken, or to update the tests with understanding of the actual change. I am really not sure what is my opinion here, lets talk about it!
1. I still do not understand what is _boundary tests_ and _clean boundary_ and _outbound tests_. What the hell is this boundary!!!!
1. Maybe a boundary is the most outer interface? Or is it the things that our program can and can not do? I do not know!!! 
1. They are talking their about seams, after a bit investigation I think that this is code that connects third party code with our source code, something close to the Adapter pattern.
1. Maybe boundaries are what we know about third party code? Or what we can promise about third party code? God knows.

## Rules
1. Here you write all the rules that were written in the chapter
1. _for rules that are not written in the chapter, write as italic text_

## Contraversial Points
1. Here you write any thing that you do not fully agree with :)

## Overall Summary
Here you are supposed to write not more then just a couple of sentences. The idea here is to give
